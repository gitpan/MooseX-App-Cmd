VERSION

    version 0.23

SYNOPSIS

        package YourApp::Cmd;
        use Moose;
    
        extends qw(MooseX::App::Cmd);
    
    
        package YourApp::Cmd::Command::blort;
        use Moose;
    
        extends qw(MooseX::App::Cmd::Command);
    
        has blortex => (
            traits => [qw(Getopt)],
            isa => 'Bool',
            is  => 'rw',
            cmd_aliases   => 'X',
            documentation => 'use the blortext algorithm',
        );
    
        has recheck => (
            traits => [qw(Getopt)],
            isa => 'Bool',
            is  => 'rw',
            cmd_aliases => 'r',
            documentation => 'recheck all results',
        );
    
        sub execute {
            my ( $self, $opt, $args ) = @_;
    
            # you may ignore $opt, it's in the attributes anyway
    
            my $result = $self->blortex ? blortex() : blort();
    
            recheck($result) if $self->recheck;
    
            print $result;
        }

DESCRIPTION

    This module marries App::Cmd with MooseX::Getopt.

    Use it like App::Cmd advises (especially see App::Cmd::Tutorial),
    swapping App::Cmd::Command for MooseX::App::Cmd::Command.

    Then you can write your moose commands as Moose classes, with
    MooseX::Getopt defining the options for you instead of opt_spec
    returning a Getopt::Long::Descriptive spec.

METHODS

 BUILD

    After calling new this method is automatically run, setting underlying
    App::Cmd attributes as per its documentation.
